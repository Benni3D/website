<p style="margin-top: 1em">bcc - brainlet C compiler</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compiler is a small compiler
for a C-like language. The language currently has a minimal
type-system. (SEE <i>LANGUAGE</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specify the file (or
&rsquo;-&rsquo; for standard output). By default the file is
derived from the file, except if the option was specified,
then it is standard output. Compile and assemble the
program. (This is the default) Note: For x86_64 and i386 it
is required that the assembler is installed. Only emit the
abstract syntax tree of the program, as interpreted by the
parser. Only emit the intermediate representation. Emit the
assembly output. Specify the level. (possible values: 0, 1,
2) Disable all <i>warnings</i>. Print the version
information. Specify a target-dependend option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output file, to which to
write the resulting output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The source file, for which to
generate the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optimization level to
perform. (default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A target-specific option.
(Currently none)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compiler aims to implement a
usable sub-set of the C99 standard, while changing some
annoyance and adding a few extensions. Some of the changes
break compatibility with the standard, this is intentional.
The compiler does not support the full feature-set of
neither C99 nor C90. But that was never the goal. This
compiler was created as a learning project and as a
successor to benc (an even worse compiler than this only
available for 32-bit x86). Changes/Extensions: - do-while
does not require a compound statement (eg. is valid). - the
pointer &rsquo;*&rsquo; is part of the type, instead of the
name ( not ). - added new basic type <b>byte</b>, which is
guaranteed to be exactly 8 bits wide. - parameter names of
function implementations may be omitted. (eg. ). - added
operator, similar to the operator. Instead it evaluates to
the length in elements of the array. - the keyword behaves
as in C++11. - function pointer types are now consistent
(eg. instead of ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported optimization
techniques: - constant folding (-O1) - micro-optimizations
(-O1) - multiply to shift (-O1) - fusion of memory
instructions for x86 (-O2) - dead-code elimination (-O1) -
constant evaluation of function call targets (-O1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently supported target
architectures: - i386 - x86_64</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compiler uses the System V
ABI, where applicable. There is no multilib support, the
compiler is installed for a single target-architecture. If a
second target is wanted, the compiler must be rebuild and
reinstalled for the specific architecure.</p>
